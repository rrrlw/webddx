Description: Freely available online differential-diagnosis generating tools are
    changing clinical medicine and biomedical research. With webddx, useRs can
    generate differential diagnosis lists given a set of symptoms. The web tools
    would likely be directly used in clinical practice, but programmatic interaction
    and data manipulation can sharply increase efficiency and reproducibility
    of research in clinical informatics. Relevant visualizations can also be
    created with webddx.
